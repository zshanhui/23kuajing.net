## Peruvian Coffee Challenges and Potential

An important part of the Peruvian economy relies on coffee, it provides income for 223,000 Peruvian families, and coffee beans is the 2nd most exported agricultural product by dollar value.

Most farms in Peru are around 3 hectares, and most of the farms are made of independent owned coffee farmers, there are several coffee cooperatives, but they cover only a small portion of the total coffee farms in Peru.
